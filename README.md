# Embedded Systems Projects and Tutorials
This repository contains multiple mini projects that I did to learn about hardware programming with the rasperry pi 4, beaglebone black and ESP32. In every mini project is a separate readme where I link the reference for the project (mostly tutorials from which I had build the projects upon) and ressource that I had used to familiarize me with the underlying theory. Have fun exploring it! ;-)

I use this mini projects as a foundation of knowlage to build upon to build greater complex systems in the future. My aim is to buy a 3D printer in the near future and build my own embedded devices with this and other knowlage.

## My Setup
+ To learn more about embedded systems I do not use sets with all components like the rasperry pi starter packets. Whenever I want to buy a new sensor or device, I'm starting with a little research what hardware I need to work with it.

### Rasperry Pi
+ To have a minimalistic IDE to develop on a headless Rasperry Pi setup, I use [lunarvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim) which is a configurable flavor of neovim.
+ Whenever I use python, I like to keep things separate, so I use virtualenv for development

## Next ToDos
+ Make scatches for the electronic circuits on the bread board and add them to the mini project readmes. (Does anyone have a good program for this? I would like to hear from you!)
