# GPIO LED blinking
+ Uses: ***Rasperry Pi 4***
+ This is the most basic tutorial that you can do with a rasperry pi. It just lets an LED blinking via an GPIO-high signal
+ It is a little more elaborated since we can press a button to light up the LED again after five times of blinking
## Main takeaways
+ Using a bread board to prototype electronic circuits
+ Basic I/O with GPIOs
+ Determine resistor values based on their barcode, reference: [here](https://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/bau/1109051.htm)
    - Resistors have different accuracy levels of their resistance
    - Use parallel/in row connected resistors if you do not have the appropriate resistor
+ What are Pull-Up and Pull-Down resistors?
